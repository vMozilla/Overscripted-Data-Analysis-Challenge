## Overscripted Web: A Mozilla Data Analysis Challenge
`August 31st, 2018: Submission deadline`

### How to participate

The Systems Research Group at Mozilla have created and open sourced a data set of publicly available information that was collected by a November 2017 Web crawl. We want to empower the community to explore the unseen or otherwise not obvious series of JavaScript execution events that are triggered once a user visits a webpage, and all the first- and third-party events that are set in motion when people retrieve content.

This is an exploratory data analysis. challenge. Mozilla would like to encourage participants to think outside the proverbial box, get creative, get under the surface. We want participants to analyze the data and come up with exciting new observations, patterns, research findings fitting into one of the following three categories:

- Tracking and Privacy
- Web Technologies and the Shape of the Modern Web
- Equality, Neutrality, and Law

The type of insights that we are looking for are illustrated in this [blog post](https://medium.com/firefox-context-graph/overscripted-digging-into-javascript-execution-at-scale-2ed508f21862). 

You can find the data set and everything you need to get started in the sections below.

### Technical criteria for submissions
- Analyses should be performed in Python using the [jupyter scientific notebook](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) format and executing in this [environment](https://github.com/mozilla/Overscripted-Data-Analysis-Challenge/blob/master/analyses/environment.yaml). 
- Analysis can be submitted by filing a [Pull Request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests) against __this__[ repository](https://github.com/mozilla/Overscripted-Data-Analysis-Challenge) with the analysis formatted as an *.ipynb file in the /analyses/ folder. 
  - Environment can be confugured locally by calling `conda env create -f  environment.yaml`
- Only *.ipynb format entries submitted via a pull request to the /analyses/ folder will be considered. Notebooks must be well documented and run on the [environment](https://github.com/mozilla/Overscripted-Data-Analysis-Challenge/blob/master/analyses/environment.yaml) described. Any entries not meeting these criteria will not be considered and no review will be carried out for error-generating code.
- Any additional code submitted will not be considered. The *.ipynb notebook should be a self contained analysis.

### Judging criteria
Analyses submitted for this challenge will be judged on the following attributes. More details area available in the __Official Challenge Rules__ included below.
#### Rigorous scientific approach
Submissions will be evaluated based on adherence to scientific method. Intermediate assumptions should be validated and supporting evidence referenced to where results are interpreted.
#### Alignment with Mozilla’s 10 founding principles
Submissions’ main finding is relevant one or more of the 10 founding principles in Mozilla’s [Manifesto](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/manifesto/). 
#### Relevance
Analysis clearly shows or targets one or more of the three categories of the challenge: 
- Tracking and Privacy
- Web Technologies and the Shape of the Modern Web
- Equality, Neutrality and Law
#### Creativity 
submission demonstrates an innovative approach to data analysis and uncovers patterns in the data set that are not superficially obvious.

### Prizes
We will choose one winner from each of the three analysis categories:
- Tracking and Privacy
- Web Technologies and the Shape of the Modern Web
- Equality, Neutrality, and Law

Mozilla may even choose to invite winning teams to present their findings in a 15-minute talk at MozFest, though that is subject to change and to the particular entries and teams. MozFest is the world's leading festival for the open internet movement and takes place in London from October 26th to the 28th, 2018.
